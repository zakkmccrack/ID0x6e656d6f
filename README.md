### 👨‍💻 About Me

I started programming in 2018 out of passion. Over time, I focused on web development and object-oriented programming.  
In 2021, I ranked among the <a href="https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it/oldsite/202/classifica-generale-territoriale-2022.xlsx" target="_blank">top 600 students</a> in Italy at the OII.  
Between 2023 and 2025, I participated in the Italian *CyberChallenge.IT*, diving deep into cybersecurity and operating systems.  
I'm currently building <a href="https://theunico.it/" target="_blank">**UNICO**</a>, a management system that integrates multiple AI services, with some friends from university.

### 📚 Beyond Code...
I believe what we do defines us—but *why* we do it gives it meaning. My passions play a crucial role in shaping how I think, create, and connect:
- 📖 **Reading** — I’m a curious reader of philosophy and history, especially classical works and existentialist thought. I’m also a big fan of comics and graphic novel!
- 📷 **Photography** — For two years, I worked as a motorsport photographer with a Canon R10. I occasionally practice astrophotography and always carry a camera when traveling or exploring!
- 🌌 **Science** —Physics, mathematics, and astrophysics are my lifelong intellectual companions. The mystery of how the universe works, from quarks to galaxies, fuels my sense of wonder!
- 🎵 **Music** — I have studied a lot of the history of music, from a purely social/historical point of view but I also play drums. This led me to meet many artists of various musical genres, starting with the blues and ending with the various genres of today. I also listen to a lot of classical music although my favorite genre remains pop-punk-rock!
